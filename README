Installation

  Instruction in the file INSTALL

Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------
  The base_matrices library consists of a group of classes
to wrap the C routines and structs from CHOLMOD. These
classes were designed to provide an easier access to
CHOLMOD without changing much of the sintax. Note, however,
that this is meant to be used as a basis for more specific
classes.

  Not all functions from CHOLMOD were made in the classes,
only the primary ones, and the ones from the Core module.
These functions were created as member functions for the
classes of base_matrices.
  The classes are:

    - base_common:   To replace   cholmod_common
    - base_sparse:   To replace   cholmod_sparse
    - base_dense:    To replace   chomod_dense
    - base_factor:   To replace   cholmod_factor
    - base_triplet:  To replace   cholmod_triplet

  The functions that should return a specific type, now
are implemented as member functions of that type. The
functions naming where following the cholmod original,
removing 'cholmod', 'common', 'sparse', 'dense', 'factor',
'triplet', and some minor changes may appear.

  Since every sparse, triplet, dense and factor must be 
associated with a common object, all constructors have to 
pass a common object (with exception of the copy 
constructor).
